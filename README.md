# Sanity + Astro Setup 

This project uses **Sanity** as a headless CMS and **Astro** as the frontend framework.  
Content is managed in Sanity Studio, while Astro fetches and renders it on the site.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```bash
PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

- `PUBLIC_` variables are safe for the client.  
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` is used **only for draft previews** (keep this secret).  

### 3. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
Astro will run on [http://localhost:4321].  
Sanity Studio is usually available at [http://localhost:4321/studio].

---

## 📝 Sanity Integration

- **Schemas** are in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/`:
  - `post`, `author`, `category`, `blockContent`
- **Content fetching** uses `load-query.ts` (wrapper around GROQ queries).
- **Images** are handled with `url-for-image.ts` using `@sanity/image-url`.
- **Portable Text** is rendered with `astro-portabletext` and custom components.

Example GROQ query:
```groq
*[_type == "post" && slug.current == $slug][0]
```

---

## 🔍 Visual Editing / Preview

- Enabled with `PUBLIC_SANITY_VISUAL_EDITING_ENABLED=true`
- Uses `VisualEditing` component in `Layout.astro`
- Draft content is shown with `perspective: "previewDrafts"`
- Overlays show which part of the UI maps to which Sanity document

---

## 🚀 Deployment

1. Deploy the Astro site (Vercel).
2. Add all required environment variables in your hosting dashboard.
3. In Sanity project settings, set up **CORS origins** to allow your frontend domain.


---

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Schemas**: Keep reusable fields in `blockContent`.
- **Tokens**: Use a **read-only Viewer token** for previews, not an editor/admin token.
- **Environments**:  
  - Development → `PUBLIC_SANITY_VISUAL_EDITING_ENABLED=true`  
  - Production → `PUBLIC_SANITY_VISUAL_EDITING_ENABLED=false`  
- **Error handling**:  
  - Missing slug → return 404 page  
  - Missing image → fallback placeholder  
- **Security**: Never commit `.env` with private tokens.

# Sanity + Astro Setup — Handover Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a **Boutee website** built with:

- **Sanity CMS** – A content management system where all posts, authors, categories, and images are managed.
- **Astro** – The website framework that fetches content from Sanity and displays it on the website.

**Key Benefits for You:**

- You can add, edit, or delete blog posts through Sanity Studio.  
- Visual Editing lets you preview changes on the website before publishing.  
- The system is structured so content updates automatically appear on the website after publishing.

---

## 2. Content Management (Sanity Studio)

Sanity Studio is the backend interface for managing content.  

- Accessible via a web browser (usually at `/studio` when running the site locally, or a hosted link after deployment).  

**Key content types:**

- **Posts** – Blog articles  
- **Authors** – Information about writers  
- **Categories** – Grouping posts by topics  
- **Images & Text Blocks** – For visual and formatted content  

**Workflow:**

1. Log into Sanity Studio.  
2. Click “New Post” or select an existing one.  
3. Fill in title, content, category, images, and author.  
4. Preview your changes.  
5. Publish when ready – the website updates automatically after sometime.

---

## 3. Website Integration

- The website automatically fetches content from Sanity in real-time.  
- Every blog post is displayed dynamically on the site without needing manual updates.  
- Images, text formatting, and links are rendered exactly as designed.  

**Visual Editing:**  
- This feature allows you to see how a draft post looks on the actual site before publishing.  
- Changes in Sanity Studio reflect live on the website preview.

---

## 4. How the System Works

1. **Content Creation:** You create content in Sanity Studio.  
2. **Data Fetching:** The website reads the content from Sanity automatically.  
3. **Rendering:** The website displays the content in the correct format with images, text, and categories.  
4. **Publishing:** Once published, content is live on the website.  

> This process ensures a smooth, no-code workflow for managing your blog.

---

## 5. Deployment & Hosting

- The website is deployed (Vercel).  
- Sanity’s content updates automatically reflect on the live site.  


---

## 6. ✅Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Drafts:** Always preview your post before publishing.  
- **Images:** Use properly sized images for faster page load.  
- **Categories & Tags:** Keep them consistent for better organization.  
- **Content Updates:** The system is designed for easy updates – regular publishing will keep your blog fresh.
