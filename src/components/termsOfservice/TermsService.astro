          Each Designer sets their own refund policy - most bespoke items cannot be returned as they're made to your specifications. We only process refunds that Designers have agreed to issue, or in exceptional circumstances like payment processing errors or proven Designer fraud.

          If a Designer fails to communicate for over 30 days, we'll investigate and may refund remaining funds. If you fail to pay agreed amounts, the commission may be cancelled and you remain liable for completed work, plus potential account suspension.

          Your Consumer Rights
        </h5>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          As a UK consumer, your rights under the <strong>Consumer Rights Act 2015</strong> apply to the jewellery you commission. It's crucial to understand that your contract is directly with the Designer, not with Boutee. The Designer is the seller and is legally responsible for ensuring your bespoke jewellery is of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose, and matches any agreed-upon descriptions.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          For bespoke items made to your personal specifications, the typical 14-day "cooling-off" period for online purchases may not apply. You should confirm this with the Designer during the commissioning process.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          While your legal rights are against the Designer, Boutee can assist by providing access to your transaction records and helping you communicate with an unresponsive Designer. Boutee <strong>cannot</strong> force a Designer to honor your rights or make legal judgments about the jewellery.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          If you have an issue, you must first contact the Designer directly. If they are unresponsive, Boutee can assist, but for legal advice or action, you should contact the <strong>Citizens Advice Bureau</strong>, <strong>Trading Standards</strong>, or consider small claims court.
        </p>

          Cancellation Rights for Bespoke Commissions
        </h5>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          Under UK law (The Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013), consumers typically have a 14-day "cooling-off" period for goods purchased online, allowing them to cancel the order without giving a reason.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          This 14-day cancellation right does <strong>not</strong> apply to the supply of goods that are "made to the consumer's specifications" or are "clearly personalised". Every jewellery Commission facilitated through the Boutee platform falls into this category.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          By finalising your design with a Designer and making your first payment for the Commission through the Boutee Platform, you are giving your express consent for the Designer to begin sourcing materials and starting the creation process.
        </p>
        <p class="font-figtree font-normal text-[14px] leading-[18px] text-textPrimary lg:text-base lg:leading-5">
          <strong>Important:</strong> You formally acknowledge that by making payment, you waive your statutory 14-day right to cancel this contract. Any cancellation or request for a refund after this point is not a statutory right and is governed by the terms of your direct agreement with the Designer.

          To use the Boutee platform and commission bespoke jewellery, you must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong>. By creating an account, you confirm that you have the legal capacity to enter into contracts and are at least 18.

          While we strive to provide uninterrupted service, Boutee cannot guarantee continuous platform availability. The platform may be temporarily unavailable due to planned maintenance or unexpected events, such as technical issues or third-party service provider outages. We will provide advance notice for planned maintenance whenever possible.

          If Boutee's services are significantly disrupted, your existing contract with the designer remains valid. We will provide updates and direct contact details for your designer whenever possible to ensure your project can continue. If Boutee were to cease operations, we would provide designer contact details and legally required fund transfers.
