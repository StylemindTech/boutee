          We’re Billy and Ethan Ward. After Covid, we watched dozens of independent jewellers shut their doors, which didn’t seem right to us — people love buying independent. With backgrounds in tech and psychology, we dug into what was going on. The problem wasn’t that people didn’t want independents; they just couldn’t find them, and when they did, the bespoke process felt confusing and a bit intimidating. We built Boutee to change that — to make it easier to discover great independent jewellers and feel confident going bespoke. We honestly think it’s the best way to buy a ring.
